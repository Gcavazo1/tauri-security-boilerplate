Our security-first boilerplate is designed for startups, enterprises, and developers who want to ship fast while meeting strict security and compliance standards from day one.

🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Security Features
Multi-Layered Security Architecture
🔹 Principle of Least Privilege – Fine-grained permissions ensure only necessary access
🔹 Memory-Safe Rust Backend – Eliminates common security risks like buffer overflows
🔹 Content Security Policy (CSP) – Blocks XSS and injection attacks before they happen
🔹 Input Validation – Every request is sanitized and validated at multiple layers
🔹 Error Boundaries – Secure error handling prevents accidental data exposure

Secure Communication & Data Integrity
🔹 Type-Safe IPC – Strongly-typed inter-process communication eliminates injection risks
🔹 Network Hardening – URL validation, domain allowlisting, and content sanitization
🔹 Resource Integrity Checks – Ensures app assets are tamper-proof and verifiable

Audit & Compliance Built-In
🔹 Security Logging – Comprehensive tracking for forensic analysis and monitoring
🔹 Supply Chain Security – Automated dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
🔹 Pre-commit Security Hooks – Runs security checks before every commit
🔹 Compliance Documentation – Ready-made security documentation for audits
