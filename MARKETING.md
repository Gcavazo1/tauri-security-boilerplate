# Enterprise-Ready Tauri 2.0 Boilerplate

## Transform Your Product into a Secure Desktop Application in Hours, Not Weeks

Built with a security-first approach, our Tauri 2.0 boilerplate accelerates development while ensuring your application meets enterprise security standards from day one.

## 🛡️ Security Features That Stand Out

### Defense-in-Depth Architecture
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Fine-grained permission system limits access to only what's necessary
- **Memory-Safe Data Handling**: Secure string processing and automatic memory zeroing
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS and other injection attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation at all entry points
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling without exposing sensitive information

### Secure Communication
- **Type-Safe IPC**: Prevents command injection attacks with validation and error handling
- **Safe Network Requests**: URL validation, content sanitization, and domain allowlisting
- **Resource Integrity**: Verify application assets to prevent tampering

### Audit & Compliance Ready
- **Security Logging**: Comprehensive event tracking for security monitoring
- **Supply Chain Security**: Dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated security checks before each commit
- **Detailed Documentation**: Security model documentation for compliance reviews

## 💼 Production-Ready Features

### Developer Experience
- **React 19 + TypeScript**: Modern frontend with full type safety
- **Vite Build System**: Lightning-fast builds and hot module replacement
- **Tauri 2.0 API**: Access to all the latest features with complete typings
- **State Management**: Integrated with Zustand for predictable state management

### Enterprise Integrations
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with security scanning
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Unit and integration test setup
- **Installer Generation**: Cross-platform installers for all major operating systems
- **Auto-Update System**: Built-in update mechanism for distributing new versions

### Optimized Performance
- **Small Binary Size**: Optimized release builds with LTO and code size optimizations
- **Fast Startup Time**: Efficient resource loading and initialization
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Careful resource management and efficient Rust backend
