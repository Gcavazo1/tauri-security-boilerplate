# Security Implementation Checklist

This checklist helps ensure that you've properly implemented the security features of this boilerplate in your application. Use it before deploying to production to verify your security posture.

## Frontend Security

### Type-Safe IPC

- [ ] All calls to Tauri's `invoke` function use our safe wrappers (`safeInvoke`, `createSafeIpc`)
- [ ] Input validators are defined for all IPC parameters
- [ ] Return type validators are defined for all IPC responses
- [ ] IPC errors are properly handled and don't expose sensitive details

### Secure Storage

- [ ] Sensitive data is stored using `secureStorage` not localStorage directly
- [ ] No sensitive data is stored in unencrypted form
- [ ] Cached data has appropriate expiration

### Input Validation

- [ ] All user inputs are validated before use
- [ ] All file paths are validated before use
- [ ] All URLs are validated before use
- [ ] HTML content is sanitized when displaying user-generated content

### Network Requests

- [ ] All network requests use our safe wrappers (`safeGet`, `safePost`, etc.)
- [ ] Allowed domains are explicitly defined
- [ ] Response data is validated against expected schemas

### Error Handling

- [ ] Error boundaries are used to prevent application crashes
- [ ] Security events are properly logged
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Errors in production are generic to users but detailed in logs

### React Component Security

- [ ] Components that require specific capabilities use `withCapabilities`
- [ ] No sensitive data in component state persists longer than needed
- [ ] No sensitive data in URL parameters

## Backend Security

### Permissions and Capabilities

- [ ] Capabilities follow the principle of least privilege
- [ ] Permission files are correctly configured for filesystem access
- [ ] No wildcard permissions without explicit justification
- [ ] Remote API access is limited to specific domains if needed

### Memory Safety

- [ ] Sensitive strings use `SecureString` for automatic memory clearing
- [ ] Sensitive binary data uses `SecureBytes`
- [ ] Data crossing FFI boundaries is validated with `BoundaryValidator`
- [ ] No unnecessary cloning of sensitive data

### Error Handling

- [ ] Errors are properly propagated with appropriate context
- [ ] Error details don't leak sensitive information to the frontend
- [ ] Critical errors are properly logged

### Command Handlers

- [ ] All command handlers validate their inputs
- [ ] Command handlers follow the principle of least privilege
- [ ] Commands with side effects are properly authorized

## Configuration Security

### Content Security Policy

- [ ] CSP is properly configured in index.html
- [ ] No use of `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval` without justification
- [ ] Trusted domains for connections are explicitly listed

### Dependency Security

- [ ] All dependencies have fixed/pinned versions
- [ ] Regular security audits are scheduled
- [ ] No known vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Minimal use of third-party code

### Build Process

- [ ] Production builds enable all security optimizations
- [ ] Debug symbols are stripped in production
- [ ] Source maps are not included in production builds
- [ ] Binary is properly signed (if applicable)

## Operational Security

### Logging

- [ ] Security events are properly logged
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive data
- [ ] Log levels are appropriate (info, warning, error)
- [ ] Logs include sufficient context for troubleshooting

### Update Mechanism

- [ ] Updates are delivered over HTTPS
- [ ] Updates are verified before installation
- [ ] Update server is properly secured

### Compliance

- [ ] Security documentation is complete
- [ ] License compliance is verified
- [ ] Privacy policy is up to date (if applicable)
- [ ] Security vulnerability reporting process is documented

## Testing

- [ ] Security-focused tests are implemented
- [ ] Input validation tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Security assertion tests validate behavior under attack
- [ ] Tests for capability/permission checks

## Final Verification

- [ ] Run all security audits (`npm run security:audit`, `cargo audit`)
- [ ] Run capability verification script
- [ ] Review security logs for unexpected events
- [ ] Verify binary size optimizations are applied
- [ ] Check all items on this list

Remember that security is an ongoing process. Regularly revisit this checklist and update your security measures as needed.
